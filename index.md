## About

Hi! My name is Andreas Olofsson and I am an electrical engineer living in Lexington, MA. For work, I spend my days on the  laptop designing invisible electronic circuits to be manufactured in pristine semiconductor factories. In my spare time I enjoy getting my hands dirty working on larger hardware projects for my family.

## Home Projects

### Tree House (2016)

Building a tree house is such a fun and whimsical project. I built a few when I was a kid, but they weren't really very good. For my boys, I decided I was going to do it right and honestly, I went a bit overboard:-) I basically built a tiny house, complete with proper framing, New England style shingles siding a roofing, sliding windows, flower boxes, and insulation. (In retrospect, the insulation was a mistake that was only usd by squirrels for nesting.). I can't say my structural analysis was very scientific, but the house is still standing strong ten years later and it definitely gets its fair share of compliments. I did learn a hard lesson in the importance of worker safety! As I was finishing up the interior, I took a step backwards and fell through the ladder opening. Amazing how quickly gravity accelerates you! I ended up in the emergency room, but thankfully there was no major damage. The tree house is now occupied by a large family of happy squirrels.

### Garage Makeover (2018)

The previous owner of our house was a general contractor who used the garage for storing the lumber and equipment. The garage was huge, but a complete mess with narrow shelves running along the side of the garage. The picture below shows the "before".

To make better use of the space, I sub divided the garage into sections for different purpose:
- A storage bunker inside the garage to hide away all my old Parallella stuff (out of side, out of mind)
- A cubby hole style shelves for storing all our sports equipment
- An electronic workb area for all the hobby projects I plan for but never get around to actually doing. Each one of the projects took about one weekend of work.

### Garage Gym (2019)

To give the family a fun play space for the cold New England winters, I turned the garage into an indoor gym complete with a climbing wall, rope climb, pull up bar, tennis wall, boxing bag, and padded floors for olympic style weight lifting. The turned out to be a life safer when the Covid era came around. The climbing wall was the most tedious project as it involved drilling and installing hundreds of climbing/mounting holes. Most of these projects were one weekend projects. The uses have evolved as the kids have grown up, but the gym has served us well.

### Patio (2020)

During the Covid era, the Olofssons like the rest of the US, were going stir crazy at home and I was looking for things to do outside the house. One of the projects on my todo list since I moved in had been to create a proper sitting area in the back of the house. To keep things simple, I decided to install a paver patio rather than a full deck. This was not a small patio and turned out to be a LOT more work than I expected. It was about a week of hard work, but I am pretty happy with the results. Five years later, some of the tiles have settled a bit, so if I ever do this again I will definitely pay a lot more attention to laying the round work. (big life lesson in there!)

### Planter (2020)

This was another covid era project. There was a dead spot next to our greenhouse that had been been used as a parking space by the previous house owner. An order of pressure treated wood, an order of top soil, some drip irrigation piping, some chicken fencing and voila, we had a nice planter for all of our earthy project. Over the years, we have grown potatoes, carrots, herbs, and flowers in that spot.

### Trampoline (2022)

A friend moving away asked me if I wanted the in-ground trampoline installed in his yard. Of course the answer was yes! All I had to do was dig out the trampoline legs from his backyard. In then end, I ended up digging up the equivalent of a small swimming pool in my own backyard. Yes, I could have rented an excavator, but then I wouldn't have gotten the equivalent of 2 months worth of gym membership in terms of workouts:-). My youngest son (the gymnast) ended up spending countless hours doing flips on the trampoline, so all the digging was definitely worth it.

### Landscaping (2025)

Over the years, I had been using the back corner of our lot as a dumping ground for rocks, dirt, leaves, tree branches etc, and it was starting to look pretty awful. It was time to do something about it!

![yard_before](./assets/images/yard_before.jpg)

During this project, I was stressed out at work and in no mood to do everything manually, so I rented an excavator. Well, just like in the book "you give a mouse a cookie", if "you give an engineer an excavator he will look for things to do with it". What started as a clean-up project, turned into a complete backyard make-over project. I ended up moving our garage driveway, making an old school fence out of 20 giant boulders, and laying down sod on the old driveway. I started the project in september and it had to get done before the winter/frost started. In total, this was a ~6 week project with many 4-6 hour hard labour weekend days and thousands of pounds moved manually. At one point I pushed a bit hard and ended up injuring my back badly. There was not stopping  winter, so I just loaded up with Advil and kept going. I can't tell you how much respect and sympathize with anybody doing hard physical labor on a daily basis.
